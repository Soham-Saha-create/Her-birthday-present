  <p class="note">I'm keeping this page simple — because this one's not about the animations, it's about the emotions.</p>  <div class="letter-wrapper">
    <div class="letter">
      <p>Hey Chandu,</p><p>Crazy how it's been such a long time since we first met, first talked, and first became friends. So much has happened between then and now, hasn’t it? I've had my share of mistakes, and we’ve had our share of misunderstandings, arguments, and fights. But...</p>

  <p>Something has always remained constant in my life — it’s you. You’ve been the Northern Star in my sky, never changing your place in my heart. I know I’ve broken your trust, shattered it more than once. Maybe all you needed was time, and I failed to be patient enough to give you that.</p>

  <p>But after everything, something really clicked in me. I've tried everything, but my heart always settles in one place — you. It’s always been you. And even after all that happened, you were still there when I needed someone most. Through the sleepless nights, when I was crying my heart out — you listened. Even when it wasn’t easy. You never refused to be there. You stayed, even if silently. And oh, do I love you for that.</p>

  <p>This isn’t a proposal — it’s not. But I can say this much: I’m trying to be better for you. I don’t want you to choose me. I just want to become the kind of person who’s worthy — if you ever do.</p>

  <p class="signature">Yours, with all my love,<br/>Soham</p>
