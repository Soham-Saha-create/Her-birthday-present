      <p>Hey Chandu,</p>
      <p>
        Crazy how it’s been such a long time since we first met, first talked, first became friends. So much has happened in between, hasn’t it? I’ve had my share of mess-ups. We’ve had our share of misunderstandings, arguments, and fights. But...
      </p>
      <p>
        Something has always remained constant in my life — it’s you. You’ve been the Northern Star in my sky, never shifting from the place you hold in my heart. I know I’ve broken your trust, shattered it multiple times. Maybe all you needed was time, and I failed to be patient enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        But after everything, something really clicked inside me. I’ve tried everything, but where has my heart always settled? On you. It’s always been you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even after everything, you were there when I needed someone the most. During those sleepless nights, when I was crying my heart out, you were the one who listened — without judgment, without frustration. Even if you didn’t want to, you never said a bad word. And oh, do I love you for that!
      </p>
      <p>
        I didn’t write this letter as a proposal — it’s not. But I can say this much: I’m trying to be better. Not so you choose me, but so I’m worthy if you ever do.
      </p>

      <div class="signature">
        Yours Loving,<br>Soham
