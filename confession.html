    <h1>From My Heart...</h1>
    <div class="letter">
      Hey Chandu,

      Crazy how it’s been such a long time since we first met, first talked, and first became friends. So much has happened in between, hasn’t it? I’ve had my share of mess-ups, and we’ve had our share of misunderstandings, arguments, and fights.

      But through it all, one thing has remained constant in my life — you.
      You’ve been the Northern Star in my sky — the one that never shifted, no matter how chaotic everything else got.

      I know I’ve broken your trust, shattered it more than once. Maybe all you needed was time… and I failed to be patient enough.

      But after everything, something finally clicked in me. I tried running, tried distracting myself, but where did my heart always return?
      To you.
      It has always been you.

      And even after everything — despite the hurt and the distance — you were there for me when I needed someone the most. Through the sleepless nights, when I cried my heart out, you stayed. You listened when no one else did. Even when it might have been hard for you, you never refused, never turned me away. You just… listened. And oh, how I love you for that.

      I didn’t write this as a proposal. It’s not that. But I just want you to know — I’m trying. I’m trying to be better. Not because I expect you to choose me, but because if you ever do, I want to be someone worthy of that choice.

      That’s all from me.

      <div class="signature">Yours lovingly,<br>Soham</div>
