    I’m keeping this page simple — it’s not about the animations, but the emotions.
  </div>  <div class="note">
    <p>Hey Chandu,</p><p>Crazy how it's been such a long time since we first met, first talked, first became friends. So much has happened in between this time, hasn't it? I’ve had my share of mess-ups, and we’ve had our share of misunderstandings, arguments, and fights.</p>

<p>But something has always remained constant in my life — it’s you. You've been the Northern Star in my heart, unmoving, always shining. I know I’ve broken your trust, shattered it more than once. Maybe all you needed was time, and I failed to be patient enough to give it to you.</p>

<p>But after everything, something truly clicked inside me. I’ve tried to run from it, bury it, distract myself. But where has my heart always settled? With you. It’s always been you.</p>

<p>And even after everything, you were there when I needed someone the most. Through the sleepless nights, the tears, the silence — you listened. You never once refused to hear me out. You stayed. Whether you wanted to or not, you stayed. And oh, do I love you for that.</p>

<p>I didn’t write this letter as a proposal. It’s not that. But I can say this much — I am trying to be better. Not for anyone else, not even for you... but for the version of me I want you to be proud of. I don’t want you to choose me. But if you ever do — I want to be worth choosing.</p>

<p>Yours Loving,<br>Soham</p>
