      {title:'A little about us',text: `Dear Chandu,

Today is 27th May, the day I start working on this entire project. I hope I can complete it before your birthday, but whatever is here, is all yours to explore.

I don’t even know where to start. There’s just so much about you, so much about me, and so much about us.

We were — and still are — the bestest of friends anyone could ever ask for. There’s no doubting that, is there? But of course, I had to write this — it’s your birthday, after all. The one day I wait for all year... more than my own. Because this day is special.

You are special.

I still remember our initial conversations back in Class 6. Even though it was all online — no physical interactions, no real idea of how you even looked back then — I still managed to fall in love. Not with your face, but with the person inside you.

If I’m being honest, I’ve proposed to you more than a few times. I always knew the answer, and yet I still did. That’s just me, I guess.

I fell in love with the warmth you brought. I fell in love with your presence. I always knew Chandreyee Acharya was never mine to have… but I never let go of hope. Hoping that one day, your answer might change.

I remember how jealous I’d get even hearing Koushik’s name. Do you really think our fight was accidental? Like hell it wasn't. I knew exactly what would provoke him — and I did it on purpose. Because I couldn’t bear to see the girl I love and my best friend together.

I was left with two choices: choosing him and forgetting about you... or choosing you. And I chose you.

I never thought I’d confess this, but yes — picking that fight with him was intentional. But there’s nothing to hide anymore. Everything that is mine is yours — even my memories.

And I guess... whatever I did — good or bad — if all of it led to today, if all of it brought us *here*...

Then I have no regrets.

Yours, always,  
Soham`

      {title:'The day you said yes',text: `My love,

It’s the 10th of June, 2025, as I write this.

Today... you just randomly decided to say yes, didn’t you?

You’ve always been unpredictable — but this? This was beyond even my wildest dreams. And the way you did it? So damn random.

"Biye korbi?"  
"I’m in, tui?"  
"Ami to always e raji chilam."

I was so awestruck, I couldn’t even speak. I just kissed you and left — totally overwhelmed. And of course, you had to ruin my plan, didn’t you? I had so much prepped to propose to you... and then you just *decide* to confess on a random walk, on a random evening.

And these two idiots — Swarna and Pal — couldn’t even let me enjoy the happiest day of my entire life in peace. Crashed. Broke an arm. Of *all* the 365 days in the calendar, they chose *today*? Really?

But you can’t even imagine how I was acting once I got home. I was literally rolling on the floor, laughing, crying, hugging your photo on my phone like some filmy lover. That moment? It’s burned into me. You said yes today. And I know — no matter what happens — that answer will never change.

Technically, we started dating after midnight. So I guess... 11th of June is our official anniversary. :)

Oh, and you — you legend — when someone’s making one of the *biggest* decisions of their life, choosing their partner forever… your first question is:

"Swarna mukh bondho rakhbe?"

I laughed so hard I almost fell over again. But yes — of course, he will. Don’t worry. Swarna and Pal won’t say a word.

I just hope we stay in love like this forever. That this honeymoon phase never ends for us. That you and I stay this beautifully tangled, forever and always.

To all the years ahead of us.  
**TOGETHER.**

I love you.

Your loving boyfriend,  
Soham`

  text: `My beautiful sweetheart,

Today, as I’m writing this, it's the 7th of July — a.k.a. KB's birthday.  
And today, you just decided to look so gorgeous that I couldn’t take my eyes off you for even a brief moment, didn’t you?

You’ve always been beautiful — more than you could ever imagine. But today? You were something else... someone people go to war for.

I know yesterday we had a big fight and you were upset with me. I tried to fix everything in the morning, but I don’t know if I succeeded. I hope I did. I’m not perfect either, am I? I make mistakes. I get angry. But step into my boots for a second — think about the entire situation. How would *you* feel if you were in my place?

Anyway, I’m not gonna stir that up again. If it ends well, then all’s well.

Actually, you know what? I should thank Anisha for not waking up on time and not showing up — because otherwise, I wouldn’t have gotten the chance to make up with you. And maybe if she *had* been on time, you’d have left earlier, and we wouldn’t have had those little moments we shared. There’s a saying — “Everything happens for a reason.” I guess we should just count this one in.

Maybe I missed the match... but does it really matter?  
I got to spend time with *you*.  
And time with you is more precious to me than any match — even if it was international.

And how can I forget how badly we turned each other on? As much as I hate to admit it, every bit of those touches was intentional — and they did exactly what they were meant to do.

In the evening, I just loved how our outfits perfectly matched — the theme, the color scheme, everything felt in harmony. I actually *love* carrying your purse, and I’ll gladly keep doing it in the future — if you’ll allow me to.

And how could I not mention those moments on the roof...  
The cool breeze barely brushing past our hair...  
The view... the weather... *us* — everything felt perfect.

I agree we didn’t have the best of times because of my in-laws, but maybe they had their reasons to act that way. Still, at least we got *some* time together, didn’t we?

And those pictures? I’ll cherish them forever. You were art today — and it’s impossible to capture art on camera, because it’s meant to be seen with one’s eyes.  
But I still tried my best... so I can keep complimenting you forever.

And today, I felt it more than ever —  
**WE FUCKING HAVE TO DO THIS.**  
**WE HAVE TO MAKE IT TOGETHER. WE MUST.**  
**WHAT OPTIONS DO WE HAVE? IF WE REALLY LOVE EACH OTHER, THEN WE HAVE TO PROVE IT TO EVERYONE WHO DOUBTS US. AND WE WILL.**

That’s all I wanted to say.

Keep looking this pretty forever — and that day isn’t far when I’ll wife you up.

Your loving boyfriend,  
Mota`

  text: `Babe,

Today is the 13th of July as I write this letter.  
By now, you’ve started calling me **BABY** — and I can’t explain how much I love hearing that word come from you. Keep calling me that and I’ll kiss you until our lips bruise. You just make me fall harder every single time.

Even rain supports lovers, doesn’t it?  
The timing... it was perfect. I dropped you home, you crossed the gate, and *BOOM!*  
It started pouring cats and dogs — as if even nature wanted us to carry on with whatever madness we’ve got between us.

It’s so easy to make even the stupidest lies seem true when you understand how the human mind perceives things.  
Do you really think I make mistakes? I don’t.  
Especially not ones like this.

I didn’t plan to reveal this — but hey, it’s your birthday. I can’t give you much, but I can at least not hide the truth.

I told you, *“I plan everything well ahead of time, but today wasn’t on my schedule.”*  
But was that true?  
Yes — I didn’t see it coming four hours earlier.  
But the moment that first raindrop hit… I *knew* what I had to do.

Walking into your house for shelter would’ve raised questions — what was I doing with you, whether it’s my ‘duty’ to drop you every day.  
So, I took the easier path.  
Who wouldn’t help a poor, soaking guy looking helpless?  
That whole misdial, the glitch — all of it was fake.  
I *really* called your mom.  
Everything after that?  
Pure acting.

I did it for love.  
For just 30 extra minutes with you.

That hug made it all worth it.  
All the acting, all the lies, the passive manipulation I briefly felt guilty about —  
I didn’t feel bad about any of it after that.  
Everything just fell back into place.

Maybe after reading this, you’ll hate me.  
Or maybe… love me even more.  
I don’t always understand you — but whatever your reaction, it was worth every second.

And oh — finally got the guts to make the first move, huh?  
Let’s see how far you can go. 
Remember, I did challenge you — that *you’d* be the one to make the first move for a kiss.  
So… let’s see.

I love the way our bodies just fit into each other.  
The height difference, the way your face fits perfectly against my chest —  
like it was always meant to be there.  
Your forehead lines up exactly with my lips —  
so I can kiss it again and again and again.

Everything about today was perfect.

I don’t know if you’ll take all this as a good thing or a bad thing — but I had to let you know.  
We promised no secrets, right?

That’s all for today —  
just me, and an unnatural number of butterflies still fluttering in my stomach as I write this and relive it all.

Your Baby,  
Soham`

  text: `My Bubu,

So we are here — it’s 9th August as I write this letter.
By now we’ve had our first kiss — 29th July, 2025. Maybe I’m just good with dates. Trust me when I say this: your lips are electrifying. They make me want so much more. You had fun that day, didn’t you?

Today was Rakhi. I know I was quite late, and I’m really sorry for making you wait so long. You won’t be reading this letter anytime soon, so I just hope I’ve made it up to you by then. Of course I would have — that’s what I always try to do, right? Still, I feel bad. I got to spend half an hour less with you and, while it might sound small on paper, those 30 minutes mean a lot to me. I didn’t want to keep you waiting; it was just the circumstances.

I know that Anisha has been a disturbing element in our relationship lately. I’m not really sure if you’re insecure about her or what you feel — you don’t always show it — but I’ll assume it bothers you, and I’ll discard her presence from my life. Not like I’ll stop being friends with her; while it might sound selfish, she can help get things to you when I can’t physically hand them over — that’s a plus. Maybe she’ll take some commission, but it works. So I’ll keep only that much of a relationship, and I’ll stop giving her free rides all the time — karon ajke toke bollam o je I felt kinda uncomfortable due to her actions. And of course I feel bad, because I made you wait, and worse — that wait was because of another girl. This won’t repeat, darling. I promise.

Now let’s come to the main part: the car incident. It was heated, wasn’t it? Every time I touch your body, I just feel like touching it more and more. Your body — the sensations you give me when I touch you — is addicting. Maybe the only thing more addicting than my tea addiction is you. By the time you read this, maybe this will be a vague memory for both of us, but trust me: after touching you that way — the way our eyes locked, your head falling back, eyes closed, feeling each touch — I can’t forget that sight, that feeling. You looked so sexy today. I regret not sliding my hand under your shirt — but anyway, I hope we keep having moments like this once in a while.

But what was even more special for me than the car thingy was that kiss — in the lion’s den. Dekh, you’ve got a dating boyfriend, and you have to accept that. Who else would kiss you with your dad on the other side of the gate, get away with it, and then chat with him like nothing happened? I don’t think anyone else would. Dekh, chele kintu kharap na — eta mante hobe.

You are literally the best, re. Mane, I wouldn’t have blamed you if you didn’t forgive me after what I did — but you did. And that’s what I love most about you, janis? Maybe you don’t forget (you sure forget important stuff 😜), but you forgive me — and of course I always try, and will keep trying, to make sure I don’t repeat those mistakes. At the end of the day, I’ve held your hand not so that you have to look for someone else, someone “better,” but so that I can make myself better for you to love. That’s all I wanted to say today.

I’d like to end this letter on this note: YOUR LIPS, THOSE EYES, THAT GAZE, THOSE THIGHS, THAT NECK — EVERY SINGLE THING ABOUT YOU IS SO ADDICTING, RE. I LOVE YOU SO FUCKING MUCH — THE ONLY ADDICTION I DON’T WANT TO GET RID OF. THANK YOU FOR BEING A PART OF MY LIFE.

Yours loving BF,
Mota`

  text: `My Roshomalai,

So this is 25th September — the day you came to my house as my friend and left as the daughter of the house.

Your birthday is coming up and I’ve planned a lot. I hope I can execute everything as planned. I’ll be really glad if I do. Today was so special, bubu — I can’t even explain it. The way you love me, the way I’m cared for, the way I’m loved… I am blessed to have someone like you in my life.

Never in my wildest dreams would I have thought this could work between Chandu and Soham, but I guess it does — and it works really well. Dekh, baba haan bole diyeche. Mane, you are officially amader barir bouma. So, Mrs. Bouma, let me know if you liked your first saree in your second home.

And that whole proposal — the ring thing — was so unexpected. I didn’t even know what to expect myself. Something just clicked inside me and I went to the shop with my mom and bought it for you. I hope you like it; I picked that one especially because you like simpler things.

How can I forget the most memorable part? That silent room, me tasting you and feeling every corner of you. The way I made you moan, and then the way you ground on top of me — felt so fucking good. I won’t go into too many details here, but I guess we both remember it crystal clear when you read this.

Officially — welcome to our family, because you basically became part of it today. Tor ekta bari na — you have two homes to come to whenever you want, and no one will say a word.

That’s all for today.

I LOVE YOU SOOOO MUCH, CHANDU. MWAHHHH.

Your loving boyfriend,

,text:`My bubu,
Ektu character break korchi okay? This is 29th September, right before your bday lmao. Onek korlam formal sajar acting now since this is the last one let's js be myself and say this. 

All this work, and you have so much more to explore. I am sorry that I am making you read all these letters (ik you appreciate it and u are allowed to slap me if I am standing/sitting beside you rn or u can kiss me too). But bubu I really really deep into this, I am deep into your and I don't see any escape from her for neither of us. We are stuck here. FOREVER. TOGETHER. Lemme talk abt this entire project first — I started it way before we started dating. The idea came to me on as far as Match 2025 but suru korechi May 23rd, 2025. 10 days before we dated. and I didn't have any hopes that we would ever date, and coming this far where we are standing rn? Cherei de. It was a dream for me re. Tui ekta dream.

Let me js yap more Abt this project cuz i fucking worked my ass off to get this thing running. Thousands of bugs, thousands of errors. But it's an achievement that I could get this thing on track. I know je you deserve way more than this but ki ar korbo bol? this is all I could. this project contains about 7000+ lines of code. Enough code to make a small actual launchable game. Still don't understand how big it is? Twitter when it was launched contained 6000 lines of code. I wrote 7000 for you. But won't brag Abt it too much cuz you deserve it love. you deserve every single line of this code. But I hope that your bday is a blast. 

U can actually see as you progress through the letters that how much our relationship has grown over time and how much we have opened up. And I am sorry that you couldn't finish and ended up feeling uncomfy but the same goes for me cuz I am equally uncomfy but let's js bear with each other? Should we? But at this stage I can confirm that we can easily last a LDR. We have equal understanding, we have equal sex drive. Sob balanced so yeah shouldn't be any issues. 

I don't wanna make you emotional rn but ami na nije letter ta likhte likhte hoe gelam. Chandu ldr, we will be alright right? We can't even stay without each other even for 2 days and it'll be years re. ofc I will come to visit but seta ar kodin bol? Every passing day, we are closing into January, amader farewell bubu. January first week is js 3 months from us. our relationship is around 3.5 months old. we have maybe not even 6 months until I depart. Ki kore thakbo re toke chara? i js can't live re. WITHOUT YOU I am better off dead. Chole jabo but konodin haat charis na okay? And I'll make mistakes karon I am a human and you will too but we will get thru them na? don't js ghost me or stay mad for too long karon bishas kor, I'll shatter. i won't be able to take the burden of hurting you. I'll make up to you re. i always will but everytime I come begging to you for forgiveness, everytime I lay my head on your feet for forgiveness amake maaf kore dis okay? cuz I am trying re, to be better for you and I am succedding but bhul korle maaf koris. Ofc cheating na tai bole but normally bolchi.

So onek bok bok korlam. ar korchi na u have a lot to explore. I LOVEEEEE YOUUUUUU SOOOO MUCHHHHH. MWAH MWAH MWAH. IF U LIKE THIS THING EVEN A LIL. JS AT THE END, GIVE THIS GUY A HUG. NA BHALO LAGLE U DONT NEED TO THO` },
