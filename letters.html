      {title:'A little about us',text: `Dear Chandu,

I don’t even know where to start. There’s just so much about you, so much about me, and so much about us.

We were — and still are — the bestest of friends anyone could ever ask for. There’s no doubting that, is there? But of course, I had to write this — it’s your birthday, after all. The one day I wait for all year... more than my own. Because this day is special.

You are special.

I still remember our initial conversations back in Class 6. Even though it was all online — no physical interactions, no real idea of how you even looked back then — I still managed to fall in love. Not with your face, but with the person inside you.

If I’m being honest, I’ve proposed to you more than a few times. I always knew the answer, and yet I still did. That’s just me, I guess.

I fell in love with the warmth you brought. I fell in love with your presence. I always knew Chandreyee Acharya was never mine to have… but I never let go of hope. Hoping that one day, your answer might change.

I remember how jealous I’d get even hearing Koushik’s name. Do you really think our fight was accidental? Like hell it wasn't. I knew exactly what would provoke him — and I did it on purpose. Because I couldn’t bear to see the girl I love and my best friend together.

I was left with two choices: choosing him and forgetting about you... or choosing you. And I chose you.

I never thought I’d confess this, but yes — picking that fight with him was intentional. But there’s nothing to hide anymore. Everything that is mine is yours — even my memories.

And I guess... whatever I did — good or bad — if all of it led to today, if all of it brought us *here*...

Then I have no regrets.

Yours, always,  
Soham`

      {title:'The day you said yes',text: `My love,

It’s the 10th of June, 2025, as I write this.

Today... you just randomly decided to say yes, didn’t you?

You’ve always been unpredictable — but this? This was beyond even my wildest dreams. And the way you did it? So damn random.

"Biye korbi?"  
"I’m in, tui?"  
"Ami to always e raji chilam."

I was so awestruck, I couldn’t even speak. I just kissed you and left — totally overwhelmed. And of course, you had to ruin my plan, didn’t you? I had so much prepped to propose to you... and then you just *decide* to confess on a random walk, on a random evening.

And these two idiots — Swarna and Pal — couldn’t even let me enjoy the happiest day of my entire life in peace. Crashed. Broke an arm. Of *all* the 365 days in the calendar, they chose *today*? Really?

But you can’t even imagine how I was acting once I got home. I was literally rolling on the floor, laughing, crying, hugging your photo on my phone like some filmy lover. That moment? It’s burned into me. You said yes today. And I know — no matter what happens — that answer will never change.

Technically, we started dating after midnight. So I guess... 11th of June is our official anniversary. :)

Oh, and you — you legend — when someone’s making one of the *biggest* decisions of their life, choosing their partner forever… your first question is:

"Swarna mukh bondho rakhbe?"

I laughed so hard I almost fell over again. But yes — of course, he will. Don’t worry. Swarna and Pal won’t say a word.

I just hope we stay in love like this forever. That this honeymoon phase never ends for us. That you and I stay this beautifully tangled, forever and always.

To all the years ahead of us.  
**TOGETHER.**

I love you.

Your loving boyfriend,  
Soham`
