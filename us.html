      <h2>2018 — The Beginning</h2>
      <p>Two kids in class 3 who saw each other for the first time. i knew you, not like I felt much for you at that time but what do you expect from an 8 year old right? i was mostly busy with my friends, fighting, jumping around while you, with your round cheeks and that heart stealing smile were busy chatting with your friends. Yes, we might have crossed paths a few times but I don't really remember holding a conversation with you. And it is completely fine tho. But those are some core memories too because that is the first time I saw you. </p>

  <h2>2019 — The First Conversations</h2>
  <p>And here we go - Two little kids in fourth standard. Still busy among ourselves with our friends. You had KB to talk to, to rely on I used to get along with Ayush, Trishanjit and Nairit. But this was the first time around when I noticed you, but considering how competetive I am, I did not see you as a love interest for myself -- rather a person who could put up a challenge academically. We had quite a few convos around that time as far as I can remember but most of them were arguements (trust me these arguments wont get any better as I progress with this story) on mobile phones and studies and stuff like that. You had access to mobile phones, you chatted with friends and I was unknown to that concept itself. But yes this sums up the 2019 era between us. Maybe not much, but it was something and these small arguements paved the path for what is to come in the future.</p>

  <h2>2020 — Growing Closer</h2>
  <p>Online classes right around the corner and two fifth graders with smartphones -- this is what I call recipe for disaster. Around this time I first got your whatsapp contact from the school group and I am still unaware why or how I decided to text you on a random evening but I did and that marked the beginning of everything that has existed between so far. These were the initial years when we started growing closer bit by bit. I was that round, fat, bully of the class who used to eat everyones tiffins and do what we call "DADAGIRI" in the entire class. But for some reason that guy became really timid infront of you. Initially my thought was that maybe its not only about you, but its for every other girl. But it will take me a long time in the future to realize that this calmness, this vulnerability is only for you and you. But this 2020 era was basically the stepping stone of the entire 2021-2022 saga that is to come in the future.</p>

  <h2>2021-2022 — Deeper Bonds and End of Everything</h2>
  <p>Around this time we were almost bestfriends. Even though you hated to say it out loud, accept it or not somewhere around this time you too were kinda developing feelings for me. Even though the feelings at that time were really vague and just the start of puberty for the both of us so the urge to love was at its peak. By the middle of 2021 we were on really good terms. I developed feelings for you. I remember we used to have these "Rate how cute is your friend on a scale of 1-10, Send me a ❤ to apply." You had a similar status that day and i sent you a heart. You game a ♾/10 rating so I thought that you must have liked me back. So beimg the guy I am, I proposed and you ofcourse said no. You deleted the status and then reposted with my pic giving me a -♾/10 rating this time around. And just like that, the girl I loved with all my heart turned into my biggest enemy. As a matter of fact we never stopped talking from that point onwards but just changed the title from friends to enemies. Anf even after being rejected I didn't stop chasing you. I spent months trying to convince you why I was the right guy for you and failed miserably each time. Then I proposed again and got rejected (trust me I am gonna say this a lot) and then came the entire Swastika thing. I wont go into much details but you know the rest. This sums the 2021-2022 era up.</p>
