  <h1>Memory Lane</h1>
  <p>
    Hey Chandu,<br /><br />
    I don’t know how many times I’ve looked at your photos — from the tiny little you wrapped in a blanket, to the girl I see today who somehow carries both mischief and magic in her eyes.<br /><br />
    This page isn’t just a bunch of pictures… it’s me reliving your journey. Your baby cheeks, your goofy school days, the glow-ups, the birthday smiles — every moment that made you <em>you</em>.<br /><br />
    I’ve been quietly collecting these, asking around, digging through memories, all just so I could see the story of you — the one that started way before I even knew you… but now, I can’t imagine not knowing.<br /><br />
    So scroll slow. Take your time. Every picture here is a chapter, and every chapter? A reason why you became someone unforgettable to me.
